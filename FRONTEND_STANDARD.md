```

### Module Organization
- Each feature should have its own directory
- Keep related files together (component, test, styles, types)
- Separate concerns: business logic, UI, and data fetching

## Naming Conventions

### Files and Directories
- Use `PascalCase` for component files (e.g., `UserProfile.tsx`)
- Use `camelCase` for utility files (e.g., `formatDate.ts`)
- Use `kebab-case` for style files (e.g., `user-profile.css`)
- Use `UPPERCASE` for constants (e.g., `API_ENDPOINTS.ts`)

### Variables and Functions
- Use `camelCase` for variables and functions
- Use descriptive names that explain the purpose
- Boolean variables should start with `is`, `has`, or `should` (e.g., `isLoading`, `hasPermission`)
- Functions should start with verbs (e.g., `getUserData`, `calculateTotal`)

### Components
- Use `PascalCase` for component names
- Component names should be descriptive and specific
- Each component should be in its own file with the same name

### CSS Classes
- Use `kebab-case` for CSS class names
- Use BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology for complex components
- Prefix utility classes with `u-` (e.g., `u-margin-top-small`)

## Component Development

### Component Structure
```jsx
// ComponentName.tsx
import React from 'react';
import './ComponentName.css';

interface ComponentNameProps {
  // Define props interface
}

const ComponentName: React.FC<ComponentNameProps> = ({ ... }) => {
  // Component logic
  
  return (
    // JSX
  );
};

export default ComponentName;
```

### Component Best Practices
1. Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
2. Prefer functional components over class components
3. Use React hooks for state and side effects
4. Avoid inline styles; use CSS classes instead
5. Destructure props at the beginning of the component
6. Use default props for optional props
7. Implement proper error boundaries for critical components

### Component Composition
- Favor composition over inheritance
- Use children prop for flexible component composition
- Create higher-order components (HOCs) sparingly
- Use render props pattern when needed for dynamic rendering

## Styling Guidelines

### CSS Architecture
- Use CSS Modules or styled-components to scope styles
- Implement a consistent design system with variables
- Separate layout from visual styling
- Use utility classes for common spacing and positioning

### Responsive Design
- Use mobile-first approach
- Implement breakpoints consistently
- Use relative units (rem, em, %) instead of fixed units (px)
- Test on multiple device sizes

### Accessibility
- Ensure proper semantic HTML
- Use ARIA attributes when necessary
- Implement keyboard navigation
- Maintain sufficient color contrast ratios
- Provide alternative text for images

## State Management

### Local State
- Use React's useState and useReducer for local component state
- Keep local state as close to where it's used as possible
- Lift state up only when necessary for sharing between components

### Global State
- Use Context API for simple global state needs
- Implement Redux or similar libraries for complex state management
- Normalize state structure to avoid duplication
- Use selectors to derive computed state

### Data Fetching
- Centralize API calls in service modules
- Implement loading and error states
- Use caching mechanisms when appropriate
- Handle authentication and authorization consistently

## Performance Optimization

### Rendering Optimization
- Use React.memo for components with static props
- Implement useMemo for expensive calculations
- Use useCallback for functions passed as props
- Implement virtual scrolling for large lists
- Code splitting with React.lazy and Suspense

### Bundle Optimization
- Analyze bundle size regularly
- Use tree shaking to eliminate unused code
- Lazy load non-critical resources
- Optimize images and other assets

### Network Optimization
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Use CDNs for static assets
- Minimize API calls
- Implement request debouncing/throttling when needed

## Testing Standards

### Test Structure
```
src/
├── components/
│   └── Button/
│       ├── Button.tsx
│       ├── Button.test.tsx
│       └── Button.stories.tsx
```

### Testing Types
1. **Unit Tests**
   - Test individual functions and components in isolation
   - Use Jest for test runner
   - Aim for 80%+ code coverage

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test interactions between components
   - Test API integration
   - Use React Testing Library

3. **End-to-End Tests**
   - Test critical user flows
   - Use Cypress or similar tools
   - Run tests in CI/CD pipeline

### Testing Best Practices
- Write tests before implementation (TDD) when possible
- Use descriptive test names
- Test behavior, not implementation details
- Mock external dependencies
- Test edge cases and error scenarios

## Documentation

### Code Documentation
- Use JSDoc/TypeDoc for functions and components
- Document complex business logic
- Comment non-obvious code decisions
- Keep documentation close to the code

### Component Documentation
- Create Storybook stories for components
- Document props and usage examples
- Include accessibility guidelines
- Show different states and variations

### API Documentation
- Document all API endpoints
- Include request/response examples
- Specify authentication requirements
- Document error responses

## Git Workflow

### Branching Strategy
- Use feature branches for all new development
- Branch naming convention: `feature/feature-name` or `fix/issue-name`
- Keep branches small and focused
- Delete branches after merging

### Commit Messages
- Use conventional commits format
- Structure: `type(scope): description`
- Types: feat, fix, chore, docs, style, refactor, perf, test
- Keep messages concise but descriptive
- Reference issues/PRs when applicable

### Pull Requests
- Create PRs for all changes (no direct commits to main)
- Write descriptive PR titles and descriptions
- Include before/after screenshots for UI changes
- Link related issues
- Request reviews from appropriate team members

## Code Review Guidelines

### Review Process
1. **Self-review** before requesting others to review
2. **Small PRs** - Keep changes focused and small
3. **Automated checks** - Ensure all CI checks pass
4. **Peer review** - At least one other developer review
5. **Approval** - Merge only after approval
